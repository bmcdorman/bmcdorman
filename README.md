### Hi there 👋

I love creating tools for roboticists and software engineers (IDEs, editors, simulators, RPC systems, languages, etc.). My current software engineering interests are Rust, computer graphics/GPGPU, and network protocols.

I'm proficient in robotics, web development (React, TypeScript, etc.), systems programming (C++, Rust, etc.), embedded systems and kernel development, compiler design and development, Cloud DevOps, modern graphics APIs, and more.

State is the root of all evil in code.
